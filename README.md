## 🏫 The Story

Hunter College sits at **68th & Lexington — right in the middle of Manhattan’s busiest transit corridor.**  
Every day, thousands of students ride the **M101, M102, and M103** to campus.  

Before **ACE (Automated Camera Enforcement),** blocked lanes and stops made commutes unpredictable.  

Our project asked:  
👉 *Did ACE — and later, congestion pricing downtown — actually give Hunter students their time back?*

## 🚍 Speeds and Reliability Where It Counts

The **M101 only gained +1.8% on average,** but averages hide the real story.  

**Corridor choke points improved far more:**
- **99th → 125th NB:** +10.8%  
- **23rd → 42nd NB:** +8.3%  
- **23rd → Astor SB:** +8.1%  
- **Hunter’s block (68 → 59 SB):** +6.3%  

ACE didn’t just nudge averages; **it cut out nightmare trips.**  
The slowest **10% of rides improved 10–15%,** meaning fewer times students sat stuck for **20+ minutes on one stretch.**  

⏰ In practical terms, Hunter commuters gained **~7–8 hours back per semester.**

## 🚫 Exemptions: The Loophole Still Hurting Riders

On the **M101, there were 21,448 exempt vehicles.**  

- Just **198 chronic offenders (<1%) caused 20% of all exemptions.**  
- One single van racked up **1,340 violations.**  
- These same plates **reappeared every 1–2 weeks.**  
- Some blockages lasted extreme durations — including a **25-hour exemption at 3rd Ave & 86th St.**

📍 **Hotspots line up with campus doors:**
- **Lex/68th (Hunter)**  
- **Broadway/116th (CCNY)**  
- **2nd/23rd (Baruch)**  

👉 *ACE catches them — but because they’re exempt, the buses and students still lose time.*

## 🏙️ Downtown Proof: When Policies Stack

On the **M15 SBS (serving Baruch + BMCC inside the congestion pricing zone):**  
- **PM rush speeds jumped +38% (3.70 → 5.10 mph)** once ACE and CBD went live together.  

It wasn’t just faster averages — **the crawl-speed trips disappeared.**  
The worst, stop-and-go rides that riders remember most were cut out completely.  

⚡ *That shows the ceiling: ACE alone helps, but paired with congestion pricing, it transforms the rider experience.*

## 📈 Terry’s Backbone Analysis

To ground the corridor story, Terry handled the **city-wide stats and fleet math:**

- **Heatmaps:** Violations thinned in Lower Manhattan post-ACE.  
- **Statistical validation:** T-tests confirmed changes weren’t random (p-value = **1.0e-114**).  
- **Fleet estimate:** ~1,100 active buses vs **MTA’s official 5,700** — showing redeployment potential.  
- **Convex optimization model:** While the corner solution wasn’t practical, it revealed **where constraints and speeds clash,** and highlighted routes that could benefit from more targeted resources.  

📊 Together, **Jayden’s corridor-level focus** and **Terry’s system-wide analysis** gave both the **student impact** and the **policy credibility.**

## 📌 What This Means

- **ACE is measurably improving Hunter’s corridor,** especially during peak hours.  
- It cuts out the **worst trips** and saves students **time.**  
- But **chronic exemptions** and limited rollout **blunt the effect.**  
- Downtown, **ACE + congestion pricing** delivered much sharper results — even eliminating crawl-speed trips altogether.  

---

## 🚀 Path Forward

1. **Expand ACE** to **M102/M103** so the whole corridor benefits.  
2. **Target the ~200 chronic exempt vehicles** that cause **1 in 5 blockages.**  
3. **Close loopholes at campus doors** (Lex/68th for Hunter, 2nd/23rd for Baruch).  
4. **Scale the ACE + CBD model citywide.**  
5. **Explore fleet optimization** to redeploy buses where they matter most.

## 👥 Team Roles

- **Jayden:**  
  Data cleaning, corridor + rush hour speed analysis, reliability metrics, exemption hotspots, CBD overlap, translation into **student hours saved.**  

- **Terry:**  
  Statistical validation (sampling, T-tests), citywide violation heatmaps, fleet estimation, convex optimization framework.

## ⚖️ Equity Impact

For Hunter students, this is about **equity.**  
Every chronic exemption at **68th & Lex steals minutes from thousands of riders.**  

- **ACE gave some of that time back.**  
- With loopholes closed and policies stacked, it could give **much more.**
