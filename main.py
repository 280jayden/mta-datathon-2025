# Datathon business questions:

# (1) Which MTA bus routes are highly utilized by CUNY 
# students? For routes that are automated camera-enforced,
# how have bus speeds changed over time?

# (2) Some vehicles stopped in violation are exempt from
#  fines due to business reasons. For vehicles that are 
# exempt, are there repeat offenders? Where are exempt 
# vehicles frequently in violation?

#(3) Some automated camera-enforced routes travel within 
# or cross Manhattanâ€™s Central Business District. 
# How have violations on these routes changed alongside 
# the implementation of congestion pricing?
